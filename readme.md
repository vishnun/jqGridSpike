This is a working spike on jqGrid.

The errors in the official documentation have been resolved for the basic spike and included in this spike.
P.S.: Official site not allowing to add comments about the errors hence uploading my own version.


To use it,
Create mysql database named "test"
username "root"
password "root"

Host this app on server which supports php.
and use the xls provided here to populate your database to test the working of the spike.



OR

update the config.php file with your own credentials.


OR if you are using any other server side scripting, make changes accordingly.
provide proper server to host , etc. And refer the official site for documentation accordingly depending on the server side scripting language.



P.S: I knew very little php and its easy to learn hence i went with it. Also i used the MAMP server for mac to host the app locally. you can use WAMP if on windows.
